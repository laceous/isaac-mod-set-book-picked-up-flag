    <description>Flash Isaac has a greater chance to spawn a Library if you touch a book. That behavior is built into this version of Isaac as well, but the STATE_BOOK_PICKED_UP flag never seems to get set. This mod sets the flag whenever you acquire a book.

See the [url=https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Level_Generation]wiki[/url] for more information.

It seems that this behavior is [url=https://github.com/UnderscoreKilburn/repentance-issues/issues/980]likely on purpose[/url], but you can enable it if you want to with this mod.

Mod Config Menu will let you choose what it means to pick up a book:
[list]
    [*]Check the player's inventory : This allows us to check if the player acquired a book by any means including starting items or via the debug console. For starting items, we can load the first floor with the flag enabled.
    [*]Check the player's queued item for a new book : This is a momentary check when the player grabs an item from a pedestal and holds it above his head. Characters like Judas (w/ The Book of Belial) won't set the flag at the start of the run which is similar to how Flash Isaac works. (Note: It's possible for another mod to clear the queue before we can check it. In that case, just switch to the other option.)
