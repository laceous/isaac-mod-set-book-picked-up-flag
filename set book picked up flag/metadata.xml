    <description>Flash Isaac has a greater chance to spawn a Library if you touch a book. That behavior is built into this version of Isaac as well, but the STATE_BOOK_PICKED_UP flag never seems to get set. This mod sets the flag whenever you acquire a book.

See the [url=https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Level_Generation]wiki[/url] for more information.

It seems that this behavior is [url=https://github.com/UnderscoreKilburn/repentance-issues/issues/980]likely on purpose[/url], but you can enable it if you want to with this mod.</description>
